1. 
Enter the following dataset in R using concatenation operator. You may edit the code fragment below:

### 37, 86, 79, 95, 61, 93, 19, 98, 121, 26, 39, 11, 26, 75, 29,130, 42, 8###

Obtain 5-number summary. You may edit the code fragment below. What is the sample mean?

Answer:
   data=pd.DataFrame([37, 86, 79, 95, 61, 93, 19, 98, 121, 26, 39, 11, 26, 75, 29,130, 42, 8])
   data.describe().T
   
	count	mean		std		min	25%	50%	75%	max
0	18.0	59.722222	38.343349	8.0	26.75	51.5	91.25	130.0

We look at the dataset titled 'cheddar' from 'faraway' package. Continue the code in the following code block to look at 

the description of the dataset 'cheddar' using help() routine. How many observations and variables are there in the 

dataset?

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4.
We are still working on the dataset 'cheddar' from the package 'faraway'. Apply simple linear regression model for the 

bivariate data 'taste' (modeled as a random variable Y) vs 'H2S' (modeled as a random variable X) in the dataset 'cheddar' 

in using lm() routine in the following code block. What is the model?

Answer:
  Y=âˆ’9.7868+5.7761 * X + erro
  where erro ~ N(0,10.83^2)
