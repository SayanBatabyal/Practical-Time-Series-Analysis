# Practical Time Series Analysis - Coursera
## The State University of New-York

Course materials for the Coursera MOOC: Practical Time Series Analysis from The State University of New York

The course has all its assignments and notebooks in R. 

As Python is the go-to language for me, this repository tries to rewrite R notebooks and all the analysis that has explained step by step, including the PDFs lessons, in Python. 

Datasets are the same and have been accumulated in its respectively week data folder.
